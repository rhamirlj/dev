        Today is such a special day — because it’s the day the world was blessed
        with someone so beautiful, kind-hearted, and amazing. And for me, it’s
        not just a day to celebrate your birth but a day to be thankful that I
        met you — the love of my life, my partner, my forever. I wouldn’t have
        experienced this kind of deep love and happiness if it wasn’t for you,
        and I’m so grateful that fate brought us together.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s funny how life works, right? I can still clearly remember how our
        story started. It was back when we were just mutual friends — we hung
        out, laughed, and had small talks because of our common friends. And
        honestly? I already had a crush on you back then. So you know what I
        did? I teased you — a lot. You were so easy to annoy, and I found it so
        cute every time you got mad at me. That’s how we became frenemies — I’d
        tease you just to get your attention, and you’d get annoyed (but deep
        down I was just falling for you even more). But of course, I didn’t
        always do that since we were in different courses, and I knew we lived
        in two different worlds — or so I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I gathered my courage to confess my feelings to you, hoping you’d
        feel the same way. But… I got turned down. Haha! I thought it was over,
        especially since you were in a complicated relationship at that time. So
        I accepted it and just told myself, “Okay, maybe it’s not meant to be.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Time passed and things changed. I got into a relationship with someone
        else, and I honestly thought I had moved on. But here’s the twist — that
        relationship became so complicated. The girl I was with turned out to be
        so obsessed with me that even my girl friends, including you, made her
        jealous. I still remember that one time we crossed paths, and I just
        pretended not to see you because I didn’t want to cause any trouble with
        my then-relationship. It was honestly one of the hardest things — seeing
        you but acting like you didn’t exist when in fact, you were still on my
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you know what they say — fate has its way of making two people find
        each other again. After my relationship ended, I stayed single and kept
        my distance from everyone. Then suddenly, boom, you replied to my
        Facebook My Day — and that moment changed everything. You just asked me
        something simple about where our student org purchased the lanyard, but
        deep down, I felt something stir again inside me. It didn’t end there;
        we started having random hugot-hugot conversations until one day, we
        started talking about being choosy in relationships. I still remember
        that conversation so clearly because I told you, “Ikaw lang naman choosy
        eh, dalawang beses na nga akong nag-confess sayo, diba?” Haha!
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, in the most unexpected but perfect way, I told you “Kung gusto
        mo talaga, bakit hindi natin subukan ngayon? Magging na tayo.” I didn’t
        expect you’d actually give us a chance. And when we finally met at
        Boulevard with your friends and hugged each other, I knew deep down that
        this wasn’t just a random fling — this was the beginning of something
        real. But I could also feel that deep inside you, you thought our
        relationship wouldn’t last long. Maybe because we started so randomly,
        or maybe you thought I wasn’t serious. But look at us now — 5 years and
        counting. Who would’ve thought that from being frenemies, getting
        rejected, crossing paths, ignoring each other, and rekindling our
        connection — we’d end up here, deeply in love and still choosing each
        other every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love, I honestly wouldn’t trade this love story for anything else. It’s
        so unique, so unexpected, and so genuine — just like my love for you.
        And that’s why I treasure you so much. Every moment we have — our
        <em>kulitan</em>, our deep talks, our laughter, our random hugot — I
        cherish all of it. I’ve never been happier in my life than when I’m with
        you. Your smile, your humor, your pure heart — those are the things I
        fell in love with and will continue to fall for, over and over again.
        You have no idea how much you mean to me, love. You didn’t just become
        my girlfriend — you became my best friend, my home, my peace, and my
        dream all at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now that we’ve built so many memories together, I can’t help but
        dream of the future — a future where you and I would finally tie the
        knot and build a beautiful family together. InshaAllah, one day I’ll
        finally put that ring on your finger and call you my wife. I dream of
        waking up next to you every day, cooking breakfast together, having our
        little family, and growing old together. I promise you, love, that day
        will come — and when it does, I’ll look at you and say, “See? I told you
        we were meant to be.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also so proud of you, love — for everything that you do and for
        everything you dream of becoming. I know deep in my heart that you’ll
        become an Architect inshaAllah. I see your hard work, your sacrifice
        each day, and your determination — and I admire you so much for it. I’ll
        always be your biggest fan, your loudest cheerleader, and your constant
        supporter. One day, when I see you in that white hard hat, designing
        beautiful structures, and making your dreams come true — I’ll stand
        there smiling, so proud that I get to call you mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        But more than anything, I want you to know how grateful I am for you.
        Thank you for loving me despite my flaws, for being patient with me
        during my rough days, for staying even when things got tough, and for
        never giving up on us. I know we’ve had our share of misunderstandings
        and rough patches, but you never gave up — you chose us every time. And
        that’s something I will always be thankful for. You’ve shown me what
        real love is — a love that stays, fights, and grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, on your special day, I just want you to be the happiest. I hope
        you know how deeply loved, appreciated, and treasured you are — not just
        by me, but by everyone around you. But most of all, I hope you know that
        I will love you forever. Like seriously, panghabang-buhay na ‘to. You’re
        not just my girlfriend — you’re my future wife, my partner, my soulmate,
        and my greatest love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday again, my love. 💖 Thank you for giving me a chance 5
        years ago despite our rocky past. I’m so thankful that you chose me. And
        I promise you, I will keep choosing you — every single day, for the rest
        of my life. More travels, more hugots, more deep talks, more laughter —
        and inshaAllah, more years of love and life together. Someday, we’ll
        look back and say, “We really made it through everything — and here we
        are now, stronger than ever.”
      </p>
      <p class="signature">
        I love you endlessly, love. Happy Birthday, my future wife, my forever,
        my greatest blessing. ❤️
